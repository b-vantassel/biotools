                    Quick analysis will apply the QGRS filtering parameters specified
                    on the more stable (highest gScore) motif within overlapping clusters
                    of motifs.  The cluster's range will be used to calculate density.
                    The advantage of this mode is that the analysis will use pre-computed
                    motif information (from the database), however overlapping motifs
                    that do not meet the filtering criteria will be included in the
                    range of each matching (most stable) motif.  This is because the
                    database does not store the overlapping motifs themselves, only the range
                    (minimum start position - maximum end position) of all mapped overlaps.
                    Unselect this option
                    to apply the filtering parameters to overlapping motifs as well.
                    This method will significantly increase run time, as all overlapping
                    motifs will be re-mapped for each associated mRNA.  Consider this
                    when applying filtering to tetrads and g-score well above their
                    minimum values, or when you are using a small set of mRNA transcripts.
                    If you are running an analysis on all mRNA, or a very large subset, it is
                    strongly suggested that you use the Quick Analyis option.
